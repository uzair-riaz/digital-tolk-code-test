<h1>Thoughts</h1>

<ul>
<li>Not a very well written code, lots of room for improvement.</li>
<li>Formatting off in some places. Code is easier to format nowadays with all the tools built-in to IDEs.</li>
<li>Redundant conditions in multiple if else blocks. Could be extracted out to make the code more readable.</li>
<li>No standard or convention for variable naming used. Camel case, snake case, etc. it just keeps changing in between and doesn't follow a set of rules.</li>
<li>Methods too long, making them unreadable. Could be extracted based on each snippet's functionality.</li>
<li>Unnecessary data passed to methods as parameters. Methods should only work with what they require.</li>
<li>Code fragments duplicated. Again, they could be extracted into smaller functions.</li>
<li>Logic and structure, from what can be seen so far, looks ok. Has room for improvement if analysed deeply, but overall works.</li>
</ul>
